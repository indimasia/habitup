# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a username and password authentication system for the habit tracking application using Supabase Auth. Users will be able to log in using their username/email and password credentials, with proper error handling and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my username/email and password, so that I can access my personal habit tracking data securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid username/email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect them to the main dashboard
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store their authentication state for the session
4. IF a user is already authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them away from the login page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when login fails, so that I understand what went wrong and can correct it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid email or password" message
2. WHEN login fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display "Connection error. Please try again." message
3. WHEN the login form is submitted with empty fields THEN the system SHALL display field-specific validation errors
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the entered email/username in the form field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login form to be user-friendly and accessible, so that I can easily authenticate regardless of my technical skill level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the login page loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive form with email and password fields
2. WHEN a user focuses on form fields THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
3. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL show a loading state during authentication
4. IF the user presses Enter in any form field THEN the system SHALL submit the login form
5. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL focus on the email/username field for better accessibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up if I don't have an account, so that I can create a new account from the login page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is on the login page THEN the system SHALL display a link to the sign-up page
2. WHEN a user clicks the sign-up link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the registration page
3. WHEN displaying the sign-up link THEN the system SHALL use clear, descriptive text like "Don't have an account? Sign up"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication to integrate properly with the existing Supabase setup, so that user sessions are managed consistently across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth to manage the session
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the auth context throughout the application
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store the session using Supabase's built-in session management
4. IF the user has an existing valid session THEN the system SHALL automatically authenticate them without requiring login
